- [x] add HTML output format
  - add `--format html` to produce static, readable reports.
  - useful for sharing in CI artifacts, dashboards, or offline review.
- [x] add per-file coverage summary (informational, not enforcement)
  - optionally show total uncovered lines per file and percent uncovered.
  - implemented via `--file-stats` → `foo.py: 12 uncovered (30%)`.
- [x] add a `diff` subcommand for report comparison
  - implement a `showcov diff a.xml b.xml` command.
  - show new uncovered lines or resolved ones since a baseline.
- [x] improve the `human` format with `rich` terminal table format
  - display uncovered sections in a compact table format (`rich.table`).
  - columns: file | start line | end line | # lines
- [ ] line-level tags / labels
  - annotate output with reasons if known (e.g. `# pragma: no cover`, `@abstractmethod`) using heuristics.
- [ ] reduce indirection in cli option parsing
  - the `showcovoptions → parse_flags_to_opts → dataclasses.replace(...)` chain is needlessly complex.
  - consider collapsing into a simpler dataclass or namespace with direct mutation.
- [ ] simplify format resolution logic
  - `format.from_str → determine_format → get_formatter` is too layered.
  - can merge `from_str()` and `get_formatter()` logic into one resolver.
- [ ] consolidate cli entry points
  - `cli`, `__main__`, `entry.py`, `util.py` spread logic across multiple files.
  - could unify command registration and dispatch into fewer modules.
- [x] avoid hardcoded format lists
  - currently, `click.choice(["auto", "human", ...])` duplicates logic in `format`.
  - dynamically generate from `format.__members__` to prevent drift.
- [ ] avoid internal state in output
  - currently includes `path.cwd()` resolution and relative paths in output.
  - consider preserving original paths or normalizing consistently across formats.
- [ ] unify file reading and path normalization logic
   - code for resolving and reading files is duplicated across `core.py`, formatters, and `uncoveredsection`.
   - centralize file access (existence, contents, relpath) in a single utility module.
