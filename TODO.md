- [x] FIX: running just `showcov` produces an error.
- [x] FIX: the human format contains a table but no longer displays the code for  uncovered lines
- [x] line-level tags / labels
  - annotate output with reasons if known (e.g. `# pragma: no cover`, `@abstractmethod`) using heuristics.
- [x] reduce indirection in cli option parsing
  - the `showcovoptions → parse_flags_to_opts → dataclasses.replace(...)` chain is needlessly complex.
  - consider collapsing into a simpler dataclass or namespace with direct mutation.
- [x] simplify format resolution logic
  - `format.from_str → determine_format → get_formatter` is too layered.
  - can merge `from_str()` and `get_formatter()` logic into one resolver.
- [x] consolidate cli entry points
  - `cli`, `__main__`, `entry.py`, `util.py` spread logic across multiple files.
  - could unify command registration and dispatch into fewer modules.
- [x] avoid internal state in output
  - currently includes `path.cwd()` resolution and relative paths in output.
  - consider preserving original paths or normalizing consistently across formats.
- [x] unify file reading and path normalization logic
   - code for resolving and reading files is duplicated across `core.py`, formatters, and `uncoveredsection`.
   - centralize file access (existence, contents, relpath) in a single utility module.
